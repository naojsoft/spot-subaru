# Site Planning and Observation Tool (SPOT)

## Installation

Follow the instructions for SPOT installation.

We recommend a (mini)conda environment for newer users.
Activate your SPOT environment, e.g.:

```bash
    $ conda activate spot
```

If you have cloned the spot-subaru source:

```bash
    $ pip install .
```

When you run SPOT, the new plugins should be available.
